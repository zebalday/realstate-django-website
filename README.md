# Baron Propiedades Website

This is a simple website for a real state agency made with Django framework. It was taken to production on a Cpanel hosting service where a MariaDB (10.3.39) instance was configured & Django version had to be downgraded to 3.2.23 for compatibility purposes with MariaDB. 

This project comprises HTML, CSS, JS, and Python coding languages; Django models are the following: Client, Property, Property type, Service Type, Region, Comuna, Image, and Interested Client.
